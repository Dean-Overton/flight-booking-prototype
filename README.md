# FlightDreamAir (Flight Booking Prototype)
This university group project involved developing a project and documenting processes, broken down activities (WBS) amongst other non-technical aspects. Although heavily weighted towards the non-technical side of the project. We were required to present a functional prototype. Here is the result.

As a key developer, I decided [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/), an online IDE would be most advantageous and lean for our team to get started.
